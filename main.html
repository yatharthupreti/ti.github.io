            <h2>Clarity</h2>
            <p>How thin is a line</p>
            <p>the width seems endless sometimes,</p> 
            <p>And somehow that hurts.</p>
            <p>Even though I walk it cautiously,</p> 
            <p>I wish it were narrower,</p> 
            <p>At least there'd be clarity,</p> 
            <p>Decisive.</p>

            <h2>Woes</h2>
            <p>Be not swayed; nor let</p>
            <p>things make thee aghast,</p> 
            <p>For woes lived are not woes endured</p>
            <p>Welcome them, live them </p> 
            <p>for truth in the moment lasts.</p>

        <div class="poem3">
            <h2>Static</h2>
            <p>I hear a shrill, monotone line</p>
            <p>passing through my skull, even in silence.</p> 
            <p>Funny enough it feels like home</p>
            <p>admist a sea of violence.</p> 
            <p>I am not a soldier,</p>
            <p>What it is to be weary; lonesome without repose.</p>
            <p>All the more reason to wonder</p>
            <p>why this void feels so close.</p>
            <p>This lack of parts,</p>
            <p>is now a part of me,</p>
            <p>My muddied mind</p>
            <p>as inscrutable, as could be.</p>
